## Contributing to Autobill Buddy
Autobill Buddy is a community project. We invite your participation through financial contributions, issues, and pull requests!

### Ways you can help
<hr/>

#### Financial contributions
We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective. Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" into the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

#### Contributing code
This project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project, maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.

#### GitHub issues by-label

Contributing documentation
You can help by improving the project's usage and developer instructions.
